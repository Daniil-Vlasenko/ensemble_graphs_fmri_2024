# ensemble_graphs_fmri_2024

Code for calculation of correlation and ensemble graphs from fMRI data of 100 individuals performing 7 different cognitive tasks. Original fMRI data were taken from the Human Connectome Project. More details on the ensemble graph construction method can be found in our paper (to be published soon) and the date can be found on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13764278).

Individuals with the following indices were selected for graph construction: 102109, 102614, 102715, 103212, 106824, 108020, 113316, 118831, 119025, 125222, 127226, 130114, 130720, 135629, 137532, 138332, 144933, 151324, 151930, 152225, 161832, 165436, 169545, 191235, 193845, 194443, 200513, 206525, 206727, 206828, 210112, 211619, 211821, 213017, 213522, 219231, 281135, 300719, 314225, 325129, 329844, 342129, 349244, 378756, 392447, 421226, 454140, 516742, 519647, 541640, 111211, 115724, 117021, 120414, 123723, 125424, 126426, 127832, 135124, 139435, 143224, 146735, 147636, 152427, 153126, 167440, 168947, 175136, 176845, 180230, 186545, 186848, 188145, 192237, 198047, 199352, 206323, 255740, 274542, 350330, 368753, 376247, 394956, 419239, 453542, 463040, 481042, 510225, 513130, 558960, 634748, 654552, 680452, 694362, 788674, 814548, 825654, 828862, 869472, 911849.
